# Luke Zhuang's Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my skills in web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The motivation behind this project was to practice and enhance my skills in these technologies while creating a visually appealing and functional portfolio to stand out as an applicant and showcase my abilities as a web developer.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is designed to present my work and skills in a clean and professional manner. It includes the following features:

- **Header Section**: Contains my name "Luke Zhuang" and a circular logo image. The header is designed to be visually striking and positioned at the top left corner of the page.

- **Menu Button**: A three-bar menu button is located opposite the logo text. Clicking this button toggles the menu window, transforming it into an 'X'. The menu window displays a picture and has clickable buttons for navigation.

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is styled to ensure it scales properly across different devices. This is achieved by using relative units instead of `px` and by employing responsive design techniques.

- **Menu Window**: The menu window features a picture on the left half of the page and includes buttons for "Luke Zhuang," "Home," "Resume & Skill," and "Portfolio." It closes when the 'X' is pressed.

- **Text Animation**: The portfolio includes animated text effects to enhance visual appeal. These animations are implemented using CSS animations and transitions, adding a dynamic touch to the presentation of text elements.
  
- **Progress Bar**: Includes a progress bar element to visually represent progress on certain sections or tasks.

- **About Me Section**: Features a section with an image, a brief introduction about myself, and links to my resume. It also includes social media icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook, as well as contact information.

- **Project Showcases**: Displays various projects, each with a description, a live site link, and a GitHub repository link. Projects include a full-stack application, a JavaScript game, a multi-client webserver, and a matrix multiplication project.

- **Skills Section**: Lists my skills across different categories, including programming languages, technologies, and professional skills.

- **Ending Section**: Provides contact information and social media links, along with a footer acknowledging the template creator.
